The User can then select the nearest UG and see the\r\nrelevant informations like next meeting and contact-informations.\r\n\r\nFrom there you can jump to their website immediately.\r\n\r\nAlso a shortlink is provided for every UG so their website can be reached\r\nusing a URL like http://php.ug/ffm or http://ffm.php.ug for the Usergroup at \r\nFrankfurt/Main in Germany or http://php.ug/benelux or http://benelux.php.ug\r\nfor the UG in the Benelux-Countries.\r\n\r\nFor that every Usergroup can register by providing a unique identifier \r\n(ffm or benelux), a website and some contact-informations (mainly email, \r\nbut twitter, facebook or Chat are also possible) and a location where (or \r\naround where) the meetings are held. Currently simply provide the informations\r\nvia the contact-form on the website.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to log in using any social plattform account associated with \r\nyour usergroup to edit entries of your usergroup. As long as this is not \r\nimplemented, please also use the contact-form.\r\n\r\nAll Usergroups will have to verify their existence at least once a year so we\r\ncan archive inactive groups.\r\n\r\nThe meeting schedule will be retrieved on a regualr basis from an iCalendar-File \r\nthe usergroup can provide on their Website. That makes it easier to maintain\r\na consistent Dataset of the schedules as the UG only needs to maintain their \r\nlocal calendar and this website will retrieve that information. If no URL to\r\nthat calendar is given, then no meeting-schedule will be displayed. **This \r\nfeature is not yet implemented. Any volunteers are welcome!**\r\n\r\nNO statistics will be provided. \r\n\r\n### Costs\r\n\r\nThe registering usergroups will not have to pay for this service! \r\n\r\nAll costs are currently covered by the team-members. But - of course - donations\r\nto pay the bills are always welcome. For more information on donating either use\r\nthe contact form or contact any one of the team by PM.\r\n\r\nAlso help by coding the stuff behind is highly appreciated!\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\nThis website will run with PHP (really?) Version 5.3+. I intend to build the\r\napp using the recent version of ZendFramework 2 which is (as far as I recall \r\nfrom memory) ZF2.0.4. But other Ideas are welcome!\r\n\r\nUsed Modules currently are:\r\n\r\n* DoctrineORMModule\r\n* DoctrineModule,\r\n* OrgHeiglMailproxy and\r\n* OrgHeiglContact\r\n\r\nThis project is hosted on github at http://github.com/php-ug/php.ug\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
