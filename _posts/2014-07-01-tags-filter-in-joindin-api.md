title: PHP-Events via joind.in-API

Until a recent update to the joind.in-API a lot of non-PHP related events have been shown on the 
[php.ug-Map](http://php.ug). To get the focus onto the relevant events we have "joined forces" and
added a filtering mechanism to the [joind.in](http://joind.in)-API that now allows to filter events by tags.

Therefore the events you can now see on the [PHP.ug-Map](http://php.ug/#events) are 100% PHP-related!

Which brings us to another story: Your event will only be shown on the map when it is tagged **php**! 
So remember to set the tags for your event!

Any questions? Feel free to contact us via [our contact-form](http://php.ug/contact)
